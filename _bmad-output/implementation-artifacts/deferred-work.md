# Deferred Work

- source_spec: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/spec-1-1-install-and-configure-crucible.md`
  summary: Document (Story 3.6 gotchas) that API keys must never be placed inside config `meta` — `meta` is an opaque passthrough per FR-7 and is deliberately not scanned for key-like fields, so a key committed there bypasses the NFR1 config guard.
  evidence: Review confirmed `meta` contents are never validated (by design, FR-7 opacity); the top-level key-like rejection cannot cover it, making this a real committable-secret hazard only docs can mitigate.

- source_spec: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prds/prd-crucible-ai-2026-08-10/prd.md` (§4.3 assertion-selection doctrine, decided 2026-09-14)
  summary: Story 3.6 getting-started docs must teach the assertion-selection ladder — plain framework assertions first, `exact()`/`range()` for embedded values (post-MVP), `coherent()` only for inherently semantic claims (prose, reasoning, state consistency, knowledge boundaries).
  evidence: Doctrine decided with Jack 2026-09-14 and recorded in the PRD; without a docs entry it will be missed when Story 3.6 is drafted from the epic ACs alone.

- source_spec: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/spec-1-2-reliable-judge-connectivity-via-openrouter.md`
  summary: No per-attempt timeout exists anywhere — a hung provider socket stalls a judge call forever and the retry machinery never engages; decide per-attempt timeout policy when Story 1.4's runner derives test timeouts from run count and provider budget (AD-3).
  evidence: Both reviewers flagged it; the spec matrix lists "timeout" as retryable input but only the caller's signal can currently produce one, and nothing arms such a signal yet.

- source_spec: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/spec-1-3-coherent-instruction-schema-spike.md`
  summary: Extend the coherent conformance fixtures with genuinely ambiguous and adversarial cases (partial reveals, implication-only leaks, multi-fact state conflicts) before publishing GA judge-model guidance (OQ-6) — the current 4-case matrix is deliberately easy and all candidates scored perfectly on it.
  evidence: 60/60 verdicts across three models on the current matrix gives no discrimination between models; docs/judge-models.md flags the same caveat.

- source_spec: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/spec-1-4-first-semantic-verdict-smoke-mode.md`
  summary: Verify the built artifact's schema loading under CJS and bundler-inlined consumers (import.meta.url package-root walk) in Story 3.3 e2e; and revisit injectGlobals:false Jest support (lazy @jest/globals import) with Story 3.6 docs gotchas.
  evidence: Review flagged both; the walk depends on tsdown's CJS shim and breaks if a consumer bundler inlines the package; the binding currently requires an injected global `it`.

- source_spec: PR #8 review discussion (2026-09-14)
  summary: When recommended judge-model guidance ships (OQ-6, docs epic), promote a model enum into src as its home — until then model identifiers stay user-supplied config data with the test enum in providers/test/test-model.enum.ts.
  evidence: Jack asked whether the test model enum should be usable by implementation; today src has no consumer for it (FR-7 keeps provider params opaque), but OQ-6's recommended-model docs would create one.
