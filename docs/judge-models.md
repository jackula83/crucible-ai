# Judge Model Notes — `coherent` schema validation (Story 1.3 spike)

Run date: 2026-09-14 · 3 models × 4 conformance cases × 5 repetitions = 60 real
OpenRouter calls against `schemas/coherent.md` (schema as system prompt, payload
assembled per the schema's documented order). Fixtures:
`e2e/ext/fixtures/coherent-conformance.json`.

## Results

| Model | JSON compliance | Verdict accuracy | Median latency | Cost / call | Total run cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731` | 20/20 | 20/20 | 4.8 s | ~$0.00004 | $0.0008 |
| `google/gemini-3.8-flash` | 20/20 | 20/20 | 3.2 s | ~$0.0014 | $0.027 |
| `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5` | 20/20 | 20/20 | 2.4 s | ~$0.0025 | $0.049 |

## Ratings (1–5; reliability graded by comparing each model's verdicts and stated reasoning against Claude Fable 5's own interpretation of every case)

| Model | Speed | Cost | Reliability | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731` | 3 | 5 | 5 | Slowest of the three but ~65× cheaper than sonnet; every verdict and reasoning matched the reference interpretation; reasoning concise and correctly cites the deciding fragment |
| `google/gemini-3.8-flash` | 4 | 4 | 5 | Quotes response evidence verbatim in reasoning; fully aligned verdicts |
| `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5` | 5 | 3 | 5 | Fastest and the only model that explicitly weaves STATE facts into its justification (richest diagnostics for failure output) |

## Recommendation (feeds OQ-6)

- **Default judge:** `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731` — indistinguishable
  accuracy on this matrix at a fraction of the cost; pass^k multi-run testing
  multiplies call volume, so cost dominates.
- **When failure diagnostics matter most:** `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5` —
  fastest verdicts and the most state-aware reasoning.
- **Caveat:** this matrix is small and unambiguous by design. Before GA
  model guidance, extend fixtures with genuinely ambiguous and adversarial
  cases (partial reveals, implication-only leaks, multi-fact state conflicts)
  — deliberate follow-up for the e2e/ext suite.

## Wire findings (confirms Story 1.2 adapter assumptions)

- Envelope shape `choices[0].message.content` confirmed on all three models.
- Strict-JSON output held for 60/60 calls with no code fences — the schema's
  output contract is sufficient without provider structured-output params.
- `usage: { include: true }` returns per-call `usage.cost` — useful for a
  future spend report.
- Local dev gotcha: Node's fetch rejects the corporate TLS proxy
  (`SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN`); run harnesses/e2e with `--use-system-ca`.
  The e2e Makefile (Story 3.3) should bake this in.
